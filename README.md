# Arrangements of 4 circles in the affine plane

This is a recreation of the animation of arrangements of circles from a [Numberphile video](https://youtu.be/bRIL9kMJJSc?t=242). I added a different type of animation (circles expanding to and contracting from infinity) for fun. Jon Wild is responsible for the mathematics behind these circles. I've only animated the 112 arrangements where all circles intersect at least one other.

A250001 refers to the corresponding entry in the [On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](https://oeis.org/A250001).
